<p>This is the 2014 archive version of sethakkerman.com. I like to describe it as the "digital calling card" version. You can view this version on the web at <a href="http://www.sethakkerman.com/2014archive">www.sethakkerman.com/2014archive</a>.</p>

<h2>Project Write Up</h2>

<p>Call me old fashioned, but I like the romanticized idea of looking a person in the eye and shaking their hand. If you're lucky, that hand shake may escalate into a carefully executed high-five routine. Today, it isn't always practical to meet prospective business partners in the flesh so I decided to create a digital calling card to help bridge the gap.</p>

<p>My most important priority was to always display the basic information and links, regardless of the device the user access the website with. To add a layer of surprise and delight to otherwise static content, I decided to give a glimpse of my recent work. As the user moves their mouse to click the portfolio or e-mail links, a different portfolio image appears in the background depending where their mouse is located.</p>

<p>If a user is viewing the website on a mobile device, mouse interaction is not an option for triggering the background image changes. To accommodate mobile tablets and phones, I generated code to trigger the image swap on device rotation. Some devices such as older android based phones and tablets do not have orientation detecting capabilities so those users only see the basic information and links.</p>
